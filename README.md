### Hello, and welcome to my profile!

**Pronouns:** They/Them

I'm a JVM programmer mostly working with Minecraft. I strongly prefer Kotlin over Java, but my smaller mods are still written in Java due to the additional effort required to setup Kotlin Minecraft mods, [RPGStats](https://github.com/P03W/RPGStats) being an exception as it was written before I learned Kotlin.

Im a huge fan of excessive optimization when its fun to do, such as [Jabber's CircuitCompiler](https://github.com/P03W/Jabber/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/mc/jabber/core/asm/CircuitCompiler.kt), which compiles "circuits" from the mod into bytecode at runtime, giving an almost 3x speed boost over the old code that simulated it generally.

Currently not doing comissions for mods, however if you ask nicely I may consider it.
