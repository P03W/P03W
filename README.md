### Hello, and welcome to my profile!

**Pronouns:** She

I'm a JVM programmer mostly working with Minecraft. I strongly prefer Kotlin over Java, but my smaller mods are still written in Java due to the additional effort required to setup Kotlin Minecraft mods. Currently working on a massive personal projec and my own website.

Slowly making my own programming langauge, too many projects.
