### Hello, and welcome to my profile! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️

**Pronouns:** It/She

I'm a JVM programmer mostly working with Minecraft. I strongly prefer Kotlin over Java, but my smaller mods are still written in Java due to the additional effort required to setup Kotlin Minecraft mods. Currently working on a massive personal project, my own website, and quilt kotlin libraries over at [@QuiltMc](https://github.com/QuiltMC)

Slowly making my own programming langauge, too many projects.
