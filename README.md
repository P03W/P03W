### Hello, and welcome to my profile! 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️

**Pronouns:** It/She

I'm a JVM programmer mostly working with Minecraft. I strongly prefer Kotlin over Java, but my smaller mods are still written in Java due to the additional effort required to setup Kotlin Minecraft mods. Currently working on community moderation and QKL over at [@QuiltMc](https://github.com/QuiltMC)

Im a huge fan of excessive optimization when its fun to do, such as [Jabber's CircuitCompiler](https://github.com/SilverAndro/Jabber/blob/master/src/main/kotlin/mc/jabber/core/asm/CircuitCompiler.kt), which compiles "circuits" from the mod into bytecode at runtime, giving an almost 3x speed boost over the old code that simulated it generally.

Slowly making my own programming langauge.
